 ESP32 Micropython DFPlayer
Original Library from another GITHUB repository - thanks
Just download 2 files main.py and dfplayer.py and sent them the the ESP32 with Thonny

Added RANDOM function to library to allow easy playing testing.
Got the is_playing function to work.
Added timeout feature to send query and capture errors
