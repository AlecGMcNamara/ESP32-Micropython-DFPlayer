# DFPlayer
ESP32 Micropython DFPlayer
Original Library from another GITHUB repository, will add credit when I find it agai - thanks

Just download 2 files main.py and dfplayer.py and send them to the ESP32 with Thonny

Added to original library:

RANDOM function to library to allow easy playing and testing. Works without renaming tracks.

Got the is_playing function to work so you can detect the end of the track.

Added timeout feature to send query and handle any errors.
